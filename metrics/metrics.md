# Metrics

A lot is happening in the Pyth network ecosystem and it is important to keep track of all the important metrics and serve them in a digestible format to enable anyone to easily review how the network performs and grows. 

These data points will further grow in importance (and coverage) as the full Pyth smart contract is deployed (data staking, reward distribution, and governance) and the Pyth price feeds are made available on new chains.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the Pyth metrics made available below, please let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/PythNetwork).
