# Solana Price Feeds

Solana Price Feeds continuously stream price updates to the Solana blockchain.
Each price feed is stored in a separate Solana account.
Application developers can simply read the data out of these accounts to use in their applications.

Pyth provides a [Solana SDK](solana.md) to assist with this process.
The easiest way to use Pyth price feeds is to integrate the appropriate SDKs into your application.
Before getting started with the SDK, please read [_Using Price Feeds_](best-practices.md) to understand how Pyth price feeds are represented, and to learn best practices to use Pyth prices safely and correctly.
