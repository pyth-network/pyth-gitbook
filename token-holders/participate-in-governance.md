# Introduction

The Pyth Network is governed by Pyth token-holders. They have the ultimate authority over the future of the protocol.
Participating in governance requires locking Pyth tokens in the staking contract. Only staked tokens are eligible to vote.

To get started with governance :
- Lock your tokens in the [staking program](the-staking-program.md) 
- Cast your votes in the [governance program](the-governance-program.md)
