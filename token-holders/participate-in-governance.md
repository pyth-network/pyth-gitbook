# Participate in governance

The Pyth Network is governed by Pyth token-holders. They have the ultimate authority over the future of the protocol. 

Any wallet that owns Pyth tokens can participate in governance. Doing so requires locking Pyth tokens in the staking contract. 

Governance involves interacting with two programs on the Solana blockchain. 

| Program       | App                                                                 | On-chain address                               |
