# Participate in Governance

The Pyth Network is governed by Pyth token-holders. They have the ultimate authority over the future of the protocol. 

Any wallet that owns Pyth tokens can participate in governance. Doing so requires locking Pyth tokens in the staking contract. 

To get started with governance :
- Lock your tokens in the [staking program](how-to-stake.md) 
- Cast your votes in the [governance program](how-to-vote.md)
