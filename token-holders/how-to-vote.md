# How to vote

{% hint style="info" %}
Pyth governance is binding and can execute arbitrary code on-chain, please make sure you understand the contents of a proposal before voting
{% endhint %}

First, go to the [governance frontend](https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH) and connect your wallet.

Once you connect your wallet, you can see your governance power on the top right corner. Typically your governance power will be more than your current staked tokens. This is because staked tokens get "boosted" governance power to compensate for unstaked tokens having 0 power.

Example: This wallet has 30.41% of the total governance power.

You'll see a list of all proposals. A proposal can be in 4 states :
-  Voting : This proposal is accepting votes
-  Defeated : This proposal failed to pass 
-  Completed : This proposal has succeeded and executed on-chain
-  Finalizing : This proposal's voting window is over, but it hasn't been resolved on-chain yet

Example: There is one proposal and there are 59min and 44s left in the voting window.
