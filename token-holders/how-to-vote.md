# How to vote

{% hint style="info" %}
Pyth governance is binding and can execute arbitrary code on-chain, please make sure you understand the proposal before voting
{% endhint %}

First, go to the [governance frontend](https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH) and connect your wallet

Once you connect your wallet, you can see your governance power on the top right corner. Typically your governance power will be more than your current staked tokens. This is because staked tokens get "boosted" governance power to compensate for unstaked tokens having 0 power.

Example: This wallet has 30.41% of the total governance power.
