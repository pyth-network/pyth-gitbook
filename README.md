# Introduction

Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple blockchains.
Our market data is contributed by over 70 [first-party publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market making firms in the world.
We offer price feeds for a number of different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/).
Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

Our price feeds are available on multiple blockchains and can also be used in off-chain applications.
Prices are available in mainnet for [Solana](consumers/solana.md) and [many EVM chains](consumers/evm.md), including Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche and more.
Prices are also available in [Aptos](consumers/aptos.md) testnet and will be coming soon to Cosmos chains and other ecosystems.
