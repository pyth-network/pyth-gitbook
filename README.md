# Introduction

Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple blockchains.
Our market data is contributed by over 70 [first-party publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market making firms in the world.
We offer price feeds for a number of different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/).
Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

Price feeds are available on multiple blockchains and can also be used in off-chain applications.
Pyth offers two sets of price feeds for different applications:
  * [Solana Price Feeds](solana-price-feeds/consume-data.md) are available in mainnet for Solana
  * [Pythnet Price Feeds](pythnet-price-feeds/consume-data.md) are available in mainnet for most [EVM chains](pythnet-price-feeds/evm.md), including Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and more.
    These feeds are also available in [Aptos](pythnet-price-feeds/aptos.md) mainnet and will be coming soon to Cosmos chains and other ecosystems.
Application developers can follow the links above to learn more about how to consume Pyth Network data for the relevant ecosystem.
