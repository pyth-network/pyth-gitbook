# Introduction

Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple blockchains.
Our market data is contributed by over 50 [first-party publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market making firms in the world.
We offer price feeds for a number of different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/).
Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

Our price feeds are available on multiple blockchains and can also be used in off-chain applications.
Prices are available in Solana mainnet and testnet for several EVM chains.
Prices will also be coming soon to Cosmos-based chains, and we are working to bring Pyth price feeds to many more chains in the near future.
