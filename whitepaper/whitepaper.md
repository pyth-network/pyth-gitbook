# Pyth Network Whitepaper

The [Pyth Network whitepaper](https://pyth.network/whitepaper) expands on the design of the protocol to ensure that it is both self-sustaining and decentralized.

End-users of Pyth data can elect to pay data fees to gain protection against a potential oracle failure. As data publishers must stake tokens in order to publish data for a product, the stake of at-fault publishers (if they make the aggregate price erroneous) will be used as a payout to those end-users voluntarily paying fees. Delegators choose which product (price feed) and a publisher to stake on top of in order to earn data fees (or lose their stake if the oracle is inaccurate due to publisher faults). Initially, 80% of the data fees will go to delegators while the remaining 20% will be shared among publishers â€” this, among other parameters, will be subject to change through a PYTH governance.
