# Pyth on Solana

## On-Chain Programs

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Solana" %}
The [pyth-sdk-solana crate](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-rs/tree/main/pyth-sdk-solana) can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your Solana programs.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="NEON EVM" %}
[NEON](https://neon-labs.org) is an EVM compatibility layer for Solana, allowing users to migrate their Ethereum applications to Solana with minimum effort.

The [pyth-neon](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-neon) library is an interface to Pyth oracles for NEON applications. It includes a drop-in replacement for common Ethereum oracles, which Ethereum apps migrating to Solana can use.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Off-Chain Clients

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
The [@pythnetwork/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/client) npm package can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain JavaScript programs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-js#example-usage).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Rust" %}
The [pyth-sdk-solana crate](https://crates.io/crates/pyth-sdk-solana) can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain Rust programs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-rs/blob/main/pyth-sdk-solana/examples/eth\_price.rs).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
The [pyth-client-py](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-py) Python library can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain Python programs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-py/blob/main/examples/read\_one\_price\_feed.py).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Go" %}
The [Blockdaemon pyth-go](https://github.com/Blockdaemon/pyth-go) client can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain Go programs.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Price Feeds

All the price feeds available on Solana are listed on the [pyth.network website](https://pyth.network/markets/). To consume a price feed, you need to look up the price feed ID for the symbol you're interested in. On Solana, this corresponds to the public key of that symbols' price account.

The price feeds available on each network are listed on the following pages:

- [Devnet](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#solana-devnet)
- [Testnet](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#solana-testnet)
- [Mainnet-Beta](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#solana-mainnet-beta)
